Welcome back! This time we are going to see something previous to the Kernel (Yes! There is something before the Kernel ðŸ˜…), specifically we are going to check how the OS Loader loads some essential Drivers into memory. To the research I'm going to focus on the Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) Driver. The main motivation to focus on this Driver is that on a near future I would like to write a post on going on depth on how the ELAM Driver works and how it helps protect the system from possible Rootkits.

## OS Loader
First the Boot Manager will write the OS Loader into memory and give control to it, which will be in charge of loading the Windows Kernel once it finishes this process the loading phases will be done and the control will be given to the Kernel, and from this point onward we can say we are actually on Windows. 

To be able to debug the OS Loader we need to activate the ```/bootdebug``` option of the Windows Bootloader entry inside the **Boot Configuration Data (BCD)**, to do this Windows provides a program call ```bcdedit.exe``` which will allow us to change the Boot Configuration. After we done this if we reboot the system with a remote debugging session attached to it we will break inside the OS Loader, more specifically inside the function ```BlBdStart``` which is the function in charge of checking the connection to the remote machine and loading the symbols to be able to debug `DbgLoadImageSymbols`. This function comes from `BlBdInitalize` which as the name implies is in charge of initializing everything necessary to debug (I guess the BlBd prefix meand Bootloader BootDebug). An going up on the call stack again we end up on `InitializeLibrary` which is the function that does everything necessary for the Bootloader to be able to execute, here we find functions like:

- ```PltInitializePciConfiguration```
- ```SpaceBootInitialize```
- ```BlNetInitialize```
- ```BlpIoInitialize```

Names are pretry self explanatory so I will not get into more details (but feel free to check them!). Going forward with the execution we will get into the main code of the Bootloader (`OslMain`) and his private version `OslpMain` (Actually where all the "magic" will happen)

This function has to perform two tasks, the first one loads the OS (`OslPrepareTarget`) and the second perform the transition to the loaded OS (`OslExecuteTransition`). In this post I will only talks about the first function roughly, as you can imagine it has a lot of code ðŸ¤£. The Kernel loading process may vary depending on the options that are activated in the **BCD** and to determine if an option is active the function `BcdUtilGetBootOption` will be used, this function is used quite a lot so we will see a bit on how it works:

<img src="/images/oslLoadDrivers/bcdGetOption.jpg" alt="BcdUtilGetBootOption pseudocode" style="margin:auto;"/>


As you can see, it will walk a structure and compare if the type that is being looked (Let's understand type as option) is among the options of the boot configuration. The structure is the following (All credit to [ReactOS] (https://doxygen.reactos.org/d5/d8b/struct__BL__BCD__OPTION.html))

```cpp
struct _BL_BCD_OPTION
{
  ULONG Type;
  ULONG DataOffset;
  ULONG DataSize;
  ULONG ListOffset;
  ULONG NextEntryOffset;
  ULONG Active;
};
```

> If we want to the get the name of one of the constants we can try an search on the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bcd-settings-and-bitlocker) and if it's not there probably Geoff Chappell has it on his **incredible** [documentation](https://www.geoffchappell.com/notes/windows/boot/bcd/elements.htm))


## OslpLoadAllModules

Allow me to fast-forward directly to one of the main functions in the Bootloader `OslpLoadAllModules`, believe me, this function does **a lot** I'll try to resume it to get into the point that concern us.

First it gets the boot flags (`OslpGetBootDriverFlags`), with this it will check a couple of things. First if the 5-level paging is active, if is the case the Bootloader will load the followinf kernel **ntkrla57.exe**. Then it will check the flags `BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE_KERNEL_PATH` and `BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE_HAL_PATH`, if they are set it will load the values from the flag (This value is a string). Finally, it will check the arch of the machine to see if it has to load any microcode update for the arch.

> This drivers have the name **mcupdate_[OsArch]** basically they contain microcode updates specif for the CPU. If you check on your PC and you see that the modification date of the one corresponding to your arch is different to the other. Then probably a KB updated the Driver that matches your arch (Ex. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4465065/kb4465065-intel-microcode-updates)

Next the function will allocate space for Kernel and the Hal, and both are loaded by calling `OslLoadImage`. Then the api schema is loaded, for this the `.apiset` section is obtained from the DLL `apisetschema.dll`, and with this section the schema is created (`ApiSetCreateSchema`) and written (`ApiSetComposeSchema`). At this point if the KD is active the DLLs necessary will be loaded and the *LastGoodSettingFlag* is checked if the jump is not taken the Bootloeader proceed to load the *mcupdate.dll*. One last step before loading the Drivers is to load the OS extensions, to do this the Bootloader search the signature *CSRT* in the ACPI table 

> This signature corresponds with the table *Core System Resources Table*, and if the system has any *Core System Resource* (DMA Controllers, Interrup Controller, etc...) which is non-standard then it must be indicated on this table and therefore the table *Root System Description Table* (RSDT) must have a pointer to this *System Description Tables* (SDT).
More info on this table [here](https://uefi.org/sites/default/files/resources/CSRT%20v2.pdf)

Lastly, *ntoskrnl.exe* and *hal.dll* import functions from other Drivers, and these need to be loaded. In the end, this is how the member *LoadOrderListHead* of the [`LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK`](#loader_param_block_notes) looked (At the point I was investigating this I was running Windows 10 version 1809)

<img src="/images/oslLoadDrivers/modules_loaded_before_drivers.jpg" alt="LoadOrderListHead" style="margin:auto;"/>

> When debuging this neither `OslLoadImage` nor `OslLoadDrivers` load the symbols (They don't call `DbgLoadImageSymbols`) so we won't have their symbols in the debugger, and to be honest **nt** symbols are quite handy ðŸ¤£. WinDbg give us the option to load the symbols if we know the ImageBase which we can get from the `LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK`.
> The command is `.reload /f /i [ModuleName]=[ModuleImageBase]`

# Loading the Drivers

Finally! How the essential Drivers are loaded. We are still on the function `OslpLoadAllModules` (As I mentioned in the beginning, I will focus on the ELAM Driver but the process can be extrapolated to other Drivers if there's anything exclusive from the ELAM I will mention it)

The first function necessary to load the drivers is `OslGetBootDrivers`, the first thing it will do is get the list of Drivers to load, this list is obtained within the function `OslHiveFindDrivers`, which mainly calls `CmpFindDrivers`. This function loads the Data Cell (` _CELL_DATA`) of the *Service* key inside the *CurrentControlSet*, with this cell the code iterate the *Service* key and the function `CmpIsLoadType` will check if each entry has the *Start* key with value equals `0x0`, if so, the `_BOOT_DRIVER_LIST_ENTRY` is initialized by calling `CmpAddDriverToList`, this function basically reads the data from the entry and fills in the structure. This goes on with all the elements within `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services` and finally we will have the member *BootDriverListHead* of the `LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK` with all the essentials drivers to be loaded.

> I didn't manage to find the complete structure of the member *BootDriverListHead* anywhere (If anyone knows it please contact me!). The most similar structure is the [_BOOT_DRIVER_LIST_ENTRY](https://doxygen.reactos.org/d2/d92/struct__BOOT__DRIVER__LIST__ENTRY.html) from ReactOS. But I'm not sure if Microsft added more values or maybe I'm mistaken. Based on what I saw, it would be something like this:
```cpp
struct _BOOT_DRIVER_LIST_ENTRY 
{
    LIST_ENTRY Link;
    UNICODE_STRING PathToDriver;
    UNICODE_STRING RegistryPath;
    PLDR_DATA_TABLE_ENTRY DriverLdrTableEntry;
    ULONG DriverLoadNtStatus;
    ULONG Unknown; /* It's obtained in the function ImgpValidateImageHash, 
                      probably related with some integitry check, please contact me
                      if you have more info */  
    PHHIVE Hive;
    UNICODE_STRING HiveName;
    UNICODE_STRING DriverDependencies;
    UNICODE_STRING DriverGroup;
    UNICODE_STRING DriverRootName;
    ULONG DriverTag;
    ULONG DriverErrorControl;
}
```

Next, the dependencies for this Drivers will be added to the `_BOOT_DRIVER_LIST_ENTRY` (Checking the subkey *PendingDriverOperations*). Finally, the function `CmpSortDriverList` will sort the Drivers based on the value *List* from the subkey *ServiceGroupOrder* within the key *Control* (This Data Cell was previously loaded).


> This is explained (Better than me) by Microsoft in the following artice https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/specifying-driver-load-order

The list would end up like this (Command: `r @$t0=[Addr BootDriverList]; r @$t1=[Addr BootDriverList.Link]; .while(@$t0 != @$t1) {dS /c 80 @$t1+10; r @$t1=poi(@$t1)}` the command `!list` would make this easier)

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/BootOrderedList.jpg "Boot Ordered List")

Two filters will be applied to this list, one by Group (`OslpFilterDriverListOnGroup`), this one will receive the string **Early-Launch**, which will copy the ELAM Driver from the *BootDriverListHead* to the *EarlyLaunchListHead*. In the image it can be seen how the Driver **WdBoot.sys** (Windows Defender ELAM) belongs to the group Early-Launch.

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/wdboot.jpg "Boot Ordered List")

The second filter is based on the Service (`OslpFilterDriverListOnServices`), this one is applied multiple times. First time to copy the **Core Drivers** to the *CoreDriverListHead*, second time to copy the **TmpCoreDrivers** and lastly to copy the **Extension Drivers**. Now Everything is ready to load the Drivers. 

> To get the Core Drivers the **DriverRootName** is compared against the following list (Within the .rdata of the binary):
> 
- VERIFIEREXT
- WDF01000
- ACPIEX
- CNG
- MSSECFLT
- SGRMAGENT
- LXSS
- PALCORE

### OslLoadDrivers

The first Driver that will be loaded are the **Core Drivers**, then the **TmpCore Drivers**, next the **ELAM Drivers**. Before loading the ELAM Driver the Bootloader checks that the boot flag `0x260000E1`(BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE_DISABLE_ELAM_DRIVERS) is not active, if the option is active it disable the loading of ELAM Drivers. In our case is not active so the function `OslLoadDrivers` is called, this function generates the full path to the Driver (`BlLdrBuildImagePath`) and calls `OslLoadImage`, from here we start going deeper into functions (With the same parameters) until we get to `LdrpLoadImage`:

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/stack_osload.jpg "Call Stack OS Load")

This function first check if the Driver is already in the `LDR_DATA_TABLE` (Basically the function `BlLdrFindDataTableEntry` iterate the table and check if the name of the Driver is already there). In case the Driver is not found in the table, the *Flags* of the Driver will be processed with the function `OslpLdrExProcesssImageFlags` (This function is obtained from some kind of vTable that contains functions that help in the loading process)

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/vtable.jpg "Load Process vTable")

After the *Flags* had been processed, the Driver will be load into memory using the function `BlImgLoadPEImageEx`. This function will obtain a *"handle"* to the file calling `ImgpOpenFile`

> I call this Handle but really is a structure, in ReactOS they call this structure [`_BL_IMG_FILE`](https://doxygen.reactos.org/d4/d94/struct__BL__IMG__FILE.html), and betweent other things it contains the *FileName* and the *FileSize*

with this handle the function `ImgpLoadPEImage` will be executed. This will load the PE, the steps are the normal steps to load a PE (**NOTE:** I will not get into al the Digital Signature and Checksum stuff, is to complex for me, I need to investigate more about it to not mess it up). The atributes of the file are retrieved with a call to `BlFileGetInformation`, then the NT header will loaded and three things will be checked:

- ntHeaders->FileHeader.Machine == IMAGE_FILE_MACHINE_AMD64
- ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.Subsystem == IMAGE_SUBSYSTEM_WINDOWS_BOOT_APPLICATION
- ntHeaders->OptionalHeader.DllCharacteristics & IMAGE_DLLCHARACTERISTICS_FORCE_INTEGRITY

if those are met, the type of hash for the integrity is obtained (`0x8004` -> `CALG_SHA_256`), then the virtual size of the image is allocated and the sections are copied. When the image is mapped in memory the digest is checked and then the image is relocated `LdrRelocateImage` and finally the physical address of the image is obtained (Not sure why it does this thou)

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/physical_address.jpg "Physical Address Image")

To finish, the *SymbolicPath* and the loaded Driver is added to the `LDR_TABLE_ENTRY`, at this point doing this is trivial, all the info to do this is accesible, the function in charge of doing this is `BlLdrAllocateDataTableEntry` and since a picture is worth a thousands words:

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/add_data_table_entry.jpg "Add entry LDR_TABLE")

the `LIST_ENTRY` of the new entry will be linked and the imports of the Driver will be loaded `LdrpLoadImports` and they will be binded through the call to `BlLdrBindImportReferences`. And that's pretty much all (Roughly, but I guess if you are reading this you have IDA ðŸ˜‰). Now the code will start returning until `OslLoadDrivers` where the member *DriverLoadNtStatus* will be set and the *NTSTATUS* is returned.

A picture of how the `_BOOT_DRIVER_LIST_ENTRY` would end up looking after the Windows Defender ELAM is loaded (The member *DriverTag* is 0xFFFFFFFF because the WdBoot Driver doesn't have this key on the registry): 

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/boot_driver_entry.jpg "Boot Driver entry")

## Conclusions

That's all folks, I'll leave some notes down below to explain some things a bit more in depth. As I mention if I have time I would like to talk about the WD ELAM Driver in the next entry. I hope I've raised some curiosity and I encourage you to research more because there's still a lot that I didn't mention.

As always, I hope you liked the post. If something is not clear feel free to contact me I'm always willing to discuss stuff related to the Bootloade/Kernel and -- It's free!!. I know I left a lot of things aside, sorry for that, but believe me th Bootloeader has A LOT of code and also a lot of complex things. And lastly, if I made a mistake, please contact me so I can fix it, I'm open to any critics ðŸ˜Š.  

## Notes

#### LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK
</a>
The [`LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK`](https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/structs/loader_parameter_block.htm) is probably the most important structure in the Bootloeader. This structure will be collecting critical information during the loading of the OS, later all this information will passed to the kernel (A reference to this structure is saved in the variable `KeLoaderBlock`). Thankfully, since version **Windows 10 1803 Redstone 4 (Spring Creators Update)** Microsoft released the prototype of this structure in a header file (Before it was in the symbols but not in a header file)

This applies to **Windows 10 Kernel Version 17763.1.amd64fre.rs5_release.180914-1434** and [here](https://www.vergiliusproject.com/kernels/x64/Windows%2010%20%7C%202016/1809%20Redstone%205%20(October%20Update)/_LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK) you can find it as a C struct.

<a name="system_hive_notes">
#### SystemHive
</a>
The function in charge of loading the System [Hive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/sysinfo/registry-hives) is `OslpLoadSystemHive`, it receives the parameters:

- A **DeviceID** which represents an index in the table `DmDeviceTable`, table that contains the open *devices* ([Notes DeviceId](#device_notes))
- A `UNICODE_STRING` with the path of the system root (Obtained with the function `OslpInitializeSystemRoot`)
- A pointer to the `LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK`

This function will generate three strings with the function `swprintf_s`. First one, the FullPath of the Hive. Second and third strings correspond to the path of the log of changes in the Hive. Next, the function will call `OslLoadAndInitializeHive` with the following params:

```cpp
__int64 OslLoadAndInitializeHive(
  IN      ULONG DeviceID,
  IN      WCHAR *FullHivePath,
  IN      BOOLEAN FlagControlSet,
  IN      WCHAR *Log1Path,
  IN      WHCAR *Log2Path,
  OUT     PVOID RegistryBase,
  OUT     ULONG *RegistryLength,
  IN      PLOADER_HIVE_RECOVERY_INFO HiveRecoveryInfo,
  OUT     PVOID HiveId
);
```

First thing is to open the file ([```BlImgLoadImageWithProgress2```](https://doxygen.reactos.org/d5/de2/boot_2environ_2lib_2misc_2image_8c_source.html#l00358)) and save a pointer to it on the variable `RegistryBase`. Afther this the [File Header](https://github.com/msuhanov/regf/blob/master/Windows%20registry%20file%20format%20specification.md#windows-81-system-hive) will be filled and finally the call to `HiveInitializeAndValidate` will initialize the Hive. This function initialize and validates the structure [HHIVE](https://www.nirsoft.net/kernel_struct/vista/HHIVE.html)

```cpp
  Hive = 0xBEE0BEE0; // Set the signature to the Structure
  Hive->GetCellRoutine = HvpGetCellPaged; // Function to get a CellPage
  Hive->ReleaseCellRoutine = HvpReleaseCellPaged; // Function to release a CellPage
```

Next, the function `HiveAddTableEntry` add this Hive to the `HiveTable`. Since this is the first time this function is called the table will be initialized (Constant to 4 entries), the address of the Hive is copied to the table (`BlTblSetEntry`) and the **HiveId** is set with the index of this Hive in the table.

Finally, if the **FlagControlSet** is active, the function `OslSetControlSet` will be called to check if the value *Default* of the key *Select* inside the Hive matches any ControlSet (The famous **ControlSet001**) and then it will change the key *Current* with this number. In memory it will look something like this: 

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/System_Hive.jpg "System Hive")


<a name="attach_hive_notes">
#### OslAttachHiveToLoaderBlock
</a>

This function is quite generic, but I mention it here because after loading the ELAM Driver this function will be called in order to add the ELAM Hive to the Loader Block (I still haven't check how ELAM Drivers work but I guess they need this Hive to work correctly). First, this function will obtain the path to the HIVE (The ELAM Hive in this case)

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/elam_hive_path.jpg "ELAM Hive Path")

Next, the Hive will be loaded by calling `HiveLoadHiveFromLocation`, which in the end will call `OslLoadAndInitializeHive` as seen in the notes on the [SystemHive](#system_hive_notes). With the loaded Hive a structure I couldn't find anywhere will start to be filled, this structure has the following format (If it sounds familiar or you know more about it please let me know):

```cpp
struct _ATTACHED_HIVE_ENTRY 
{
  LISTR_ENTRY Link;
  WCHAR * HiveName;
  ULONG Unknow; /* I feel like is some kind of ID, but not sure */
  PVOID HiveBase;
  ULONG HiveSize;
  WCHAR *StandardHiveName;
  WCHAR *HiveSubtree;
}
```

Finally, the structure is linked to the to the member `LoaderParamBlock->Extension->AttachedHives` through the `LIST_ENTRY`.

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/attached_hive_struct.jpg "Attached Hive")

<a name="device_notes">
#### DeviceId
</a>

The **DeviceId** is obtained using the function `OslpOpenDevices`, this function first look to see if the *device* is already open (`BlpDeviceOpen`) to do this it will call `BlTblFindEntry` with first parameter as the table of open *devices* `DmDeviceTable`, second as the number of entries in this table `DmTableEntries` and fourth is a pointer to the  function `DeviceTableCompare` (This is the function that checks if the *device* we are looking for is inside the `DmTableEntries`)

The function `OslpOpenDevices` will open the *device* pointed by the variable `OslLoadDevice` (Also if the boot options `BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE_BSP_DEVICE` and `BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE_OS_DATA_DEVICE` are set those *devices* will be open respectively). I will only review the first case, variable `OslLoadDevice` was previously assigned from the boot flag `0x21000001` (`BCDE_OSLOADER_TYPE_OS_DEVICE`). This *device* is no other than the Volume where the Bootloader reside. In my case the Bootloader (**winload.efi**) is in the Volume `C:`, the following image shows the *device* accessing to it from the `OslLoadDevice` variable and accessing to it through the `DmDeviceTable` (In this case I know is the index 4)

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/guid_deviceObject.jpg "Device Object")

> In ReactOS the structure pointed by the variable `OslLoadDevice` is called [```_BL_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR```](https://doxygen.reactos.org/dd/d76/struct__BL__DEVICE__DESCRIPTOR.html#a67f2887f7c88a8e27757add9d869c39d). I couldn't find any other references to this structure nor a similar structure.

In the following image we can see how the GUID we obtained previoulsy from the *device* matches the Volume `C:`, and also matches the Volume where the Bootloader is stored 

 <img src="/images/oslLoadDrivers/guid_check.jpg" alt="Device Object Check" style="margin:auto;"/>


Lastly, and I'm not totally sure about this (That's why I left it to the end ðŸ¤£). Before I mentioned that the *device* is the index 4 in the array. If we check with the tool [WinObj](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/winobj) the *HardDisk0*, we can see that the partition 4 points to *HardDiskVolume4*. On the other hand, the object *BootPartition* and the object *BootDevice* point to the same Volume. By this, I guess that when the Bootloader initialize the *devices* it fills the `DmDeviceTable` in the order in which the partitions are arranged.

![alt img](/images/oslLoadDrivers/harddisk_volume4.jpg "HardDisk Volume 4")

> If I'm not wrong the *devices* are initalized by the function `SpaceBootInitialize` with the call to `SB_CONTROL::BuildDevices`, so this would be a good point to confirm this last paragraph (I could be totally wrong assuming *devices* are initialized, haven't reversed this I just suspect it from the name)
